It's not easy to take sometimes.\n\nIt's uncomfortable, because it asks things of us.\n\nBut there's also something magical about it - you usually find it exactly when you need it, and when you do it usually tastes sweet."

Are you so sure your own story starts with your birth? All you can say for sure is that your memories seem to begin when you were a child but does that mark the start of you?\n\nDeath might take the world from you, but are you so sure it can steal your consciousness? We make assumptions about life and death for which we have zero evidence.\n\nMysticism exists because of the intuitions we have about the nature of reality. We intuit ourselves to be more than this body and this world because we are more - much more. The life of a mystic is oriented around the discovery of what that ‘more' is.\n\nSo, stop fearing death. Stop fearing the great unknown. Death is natural, and part of life. And it could be your greatest teacher."

            "title": "The Importance of Good Habits",
            "contents": "Good habits are critical to an intentional life. As we live our lives, we pick up a number of bad habits along the way, and it's up to us to break these habits for the sake of our own health, happiness, and peace. There are many bad habits we might have, but I will focus on just a few of them here:\n\nSmoking\nNarcotic Abuse\nAlcohol Abuse\nGambling\nExcessive Eating or Overeating\nCompulsive Shopping\nExcessive Worrying or Stressful Thinking\nToo much TV-watching.\n\nThe good news is that all of the above habits are both difficult and easy to break. Once they are broken, they can not be picked back up again.\n\nSmoking: Smoking is an addiction that we're all familiar with - it's high time we stop. What I want to focus on here are just three ways in which many people have found success in breaking the habit:\n- Join a support group for quitting smoking\n- Invest in your physical health by eating healthy, exercising, and getting enough sleep\n- Develop a meditation practice and make the most of this wonderful tool for health and happiness.\n- If you're not ready to quit yet, at least quit the cigarettes and start vaping instead, Your lungs will thank you.\n\nNarcotic Abuse: Narcotics abuse is something that many people struggle with after a personal trauma. It's key to remember that narcotic abuse is self-medication - it helps us to feel better temporarily because it numbs us, but ultimately it causes more pain and suffering than before taking them. The single most important thing you can do if you struggle with narcotic abuse is find other ways of coping - talk to a therapist or counselor about other ways of dealing with your pain.\n\nAlcohol Abuse: Alcohol abuse is another common issue people face after difficulties in life, or as an escape mechanism. It's crucial to remember that alcohol is a depressant, and while it may make you feel better in the short-term, it will ultimately make you feel worse. If you want to break the habit of alcohol abuse, it's important to find other ways of coping with your emotions - talk to a therapist about other ways of dealing with your pain.\n\nGambling: Gambling is a difficult habit to break because it's so easy to get caught up in the excitement of the game and the potential winnings. It's important to remember that gambling is a form of entertainment - it should not be used as a way to make money. If you want to break the habit of gambling, it's important to find other forms of entertainment that don't involve risk-taking.\n\nExcessive Eating or Overeating: Excessive eating or overeating is often a response to emotional difficulties in life. Food is soothing and comforting, but ultimately it will not make our problems go away. If we want to break this habit, we need to find other ways of dealing with our emotions - talk to a therapist about other ways of coping with your pain.\n\nCompulsive Shopping: Compulsive shopping is another form of self-medication - we use shopping to make ourselves feel better, but in the end it just causes more stress and anxiety. If you want to break this habit, it's important to find other ways of making yourself feel good - talk to a therapist about other ways of coping with your pain.\n\nExcessive Worrying or Stressful Thinking: Excessive worrying or stressful thinking is a common habit that many of us have. It's important to remember that worry and stress are just thoughts - they are not reality. If we want to break this habit, we need to find other ways of dealing with our thoughts - talk to a therapist about other ways of cope with your pain.\n\nToo much TV-watching: Too much TV-watching is a common issue in our society. It's important to remember that TV is just entertainment - it should not be used as a way to escape from our problems. If you want to break this habit, it's important to find other forms of entertainment that don't involve sitting in front of a screen for hours on end.\n\nThe bottom line is that good habits are key to living an intentional life. They are easy to form, but difficult to break. It's important to find other ways of coping with our emotions and our thoughts so that we can break these bad habits for good.",

            "title": "Establish a Regular Meditation Practice",
            "contents": "Meditation is a powerful tool that can help us to live more intentional lives. Meditation helps us to focus our attention on the present moment, and it allows us to let go of the past and future. Meditation is like a shower for our mind and soul. It helps us to relax and to be more mindful of our thoughts and emotions.\n\nThere are many different types of meditation, but the most important thing is to find a type of meditation that works for you. There is no one “right” way to meditate - what matters is that you are able to focus your attention on the present moment.\n\nSome people find it helpful to meditate with their eyes open, while others find it helpful to meditate with their eyes closed. Some people find it helpful to meditate in silence, while others find it helpful to meditate with music or nature sounds. Some people find it helpful to use a mantra or affirmation, while others find it helpful to simply focus on their breath.\n\nThe most important thing is that you find a type of meditation that works for you, and that you make time for it every day. A regular meditation practice is the best habit you can establish. It will make all the difference in your life.\n\nHere are a few meditation techniques you can try:\n\nTechnique 1 - Watch your Breath:\n\nFind a comfortable place to sit, and simply focus your attention on your breath. Watch as your breath goes in and out. Don't try to control your breath, simply observe it. If your mind wanders, simply bring your attention back to your breath.\n\nTechnique 2 - Body Scan:\n\nStart by focusing your attention on your breath. Once you have settled into a rhythm of breathing, begin to scan your body from head to toe, noticing any tension or relaxation in your muscles. Don't try to change anything, simply observe. If your mind wanders, simply bring your attention back to your breath and start again.\n\nTechnique 3 - Guided Meditation:\n\nThere are many guided meditations available online or on apps like Headspace or Calm. Find a guided meditation that you like, and follow along with the instructions. This type of meditation can be especially helpful if you find it difficult to focus your attention on the present moment.\n\nTechnique 4 - Feel your chakras\n\nThis powerful meditation technique both calms and energizes the body and mind. When practiced correctly, it can rapidly transform your life! Only try this once you've established a bit of regularity with your practice. The technique is simple - you will spend your time in meditation first focusing on your third chakra, located just above your navel. As you focus on this chakra, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. Spend about five minutes doing so. When your mind wanders, refocus back onto the chakra Then, move your focus to your fourth chakra, located in the center of your chest. Again, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. Finally, move your focus to your sixth chakra, located in between your eyebrows. Once again, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. This powerful technique will help to calm and focus the mind, while also energizing the body.",

If your mind wanders, simply bring your attention back to your breath and start again.\n\nTechnique 3 - Guided Meditation:\n\nThere are many guided meditations available online or on apps like Headspace or Calm. Find a guided meditation that you like, and follow along with the instructions. This type of meditation can be especially helpful if you find it difficult to focus your attention on the present moment.\n\nTechnique 4 - Feel your chakras:\n\nThis powerful meditation technique both calms and energizes the body and mind. When practiced correctly, it can rapidly transform your life! Only try this once you've established a bit of regularity with your practice. The technique is simple - you will spend your time in meditation first focusing on your third chakra, located just above your navel. As you focus on this chakra, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. Spend about five minutes doing so. When your mind wanders, refocus back onto the chakra Then, move your focus to your fourth chakra, located in the center of your chest. Again, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. Finally, move your focus to your sixth chakra, located in between your eyebrows. Once again, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. This powerful technique will help to calm and focus the mind, while also energizing the body."
