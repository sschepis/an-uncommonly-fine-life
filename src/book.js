We make assumptions about life and death for which we have zero evidence.\n\nMysticism exists because of the intuitions we have about the nature of reality. We intuit ourselves to be more than this body and this world because we are more - much more. The life of a mystic is oriented around the discovery of what that ‘more' is.\n\nSo, stop fearing death.

However, this is not true. Time is a created thing. It is an illusion.\n\nThe present moment is all there is. It is the only moment we have to live. And yet, we spend so much of our time living in the past or the future. We think about the things we have to do, or the things we have done. We worry about what might happen, or what could have happened. We are always living in our heads, instead of in the present moment.\n\nThe present moment is a gift. It is a miracle. It is the only moment we have to live.\n\nIn order to live a happy and fulfilled life, we need to learn how to be in the present moment. This is where a regular meditation practice can be incredibly helpful. Meditation allows us to focus our attention on the present moment, and to let go of the thoughts and worries that keep us trapped in the past or the future.\n\nWhen we learn how to be in the present moment, we learn how to live. We learn how to enjoy our lives, instead of just surviving from one moment to the next. We learn how to be happy, instead of just chasing after happiness.",

Learn as if you were to live forever.\" - Mahatma Gandhi\n\n\"The only true wisdom is in knowing you know nothing.\" - Socrates\n\nYou are the only one who can teach yourself. No one else can do it for you.\n\nThis may seem like a strange thing to say, but it's true. Every single person is responsible for their own education. We may have teachers and mentors who can guide us, but ultimately, it is up to us to learn.\n\nThis is because learning is not a passive process. It is an active process. We learn by doing, by experiencing, by making mistakes. No one can teach us everything we need to know. We have to learn for ourselves.\n\nThis can be a scary thought. It means that we are responsible for our own lives. It means that we can't blame others for our mistakes. It means that we have to take risks.\n\nHowever, it also means that we are in control of our own lives. We get to choose what we want to learn. We get to choose what we want to do with our lives. We get to make our own decisions.\n\nThis is a liberating thought. It means that we are not limited by what others think we should do. It means that we are free to be our own person. It means that we can create our own destiny.\n\nSo, if you want to change your life, change the way you learn. Stop waiting for someone else to teach you what you need to know. Start learning for yourself. Start taking risks. Start making mistakes. And most importantly, start living your life.",

You create your reality.\n\nLiving with intention means being conscious with the choices that you make, whatever they might be. Doing this is simple - when you are acting in the world, carve out a portion of your conscious attention which you dedicate solely towards observing yourself acting. \n\nThe way you do this is through repetition - it's not something that takes a day or even a year to develop - it's a lifelong process of learning.\n\nIt's important to practice intention without judgment or expectation. Critical, even. You're not really trying to do or accomplish anything with this portion of yourself - just be present with yourself. Bring judgment or a goal-orientation to this activity tends to reinforce those tendencies, not diminish them.

Watch as your breath goes in and out. Don't try to control your breath, simply observe it. If your mind wanders, simply bring your attention back to your breath.\n\nTechnique 2 - Body Scan:\n\nStart by focusing your attention on your breath. Once you have settled into a rhythm of breathing, begin to scan your body from head to toe, noticing any tension or relaxation in your muscles. Don't try to change anything, simply observe. If your mind wanders, simply bring your attention back to your breath and start again.\n\nTechnique 3 - Guided Meditation:\n\nThere are many guided meditations available online or on apps like Headspace or Calm. Find a guided meditation that you like, and follow along with the instructions. This type of meditation can be especially helpful if you find it difficult to focus your attention on the present moment.\n\nTechnique 4 - Feel your chakras:\n\nThis powerful meditation technique both calms and energizes the body and mind. When practiced correctly, it can rapidly transform your life! Only try this once you've established a bit of regularity with your practice. The technique is simple - you will spend your time in meditation first focusing on your third chakra, located just above your navel. As you focus on this chakra, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. Spend about five minutes doing so. When your mind wanders, refocus back onto the chakra Then, move your focus to your fourth chakra, located in the center of your chest. Again, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. Finally, move your focus to your sixth chakra, located in between your eyebrows. Once again, feel the energy swirling around inside of you. This powerful technique will help to calm and focus the mind, while also energizing the body."
